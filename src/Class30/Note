Map:
   map is an interface in java that allow us to get key valur pairs
   keys cant be duplicate but value can b be.
   their are many types of map but we will study only three of them.
1)Hash map:
2)linked Hash map:
3)tree Hash map:

Hash map:
   upside:it the fast of all.
   downside: dose not maintained the insert order.
linked Hash Map:
   upside: order is maintained.
   downside: retail speed is slow insert speed is better then tree map and-
   slow than hash map.
tree map:
   upside data is slow store insert  of order.
   dow side insert speed slowest at all  derail speed is slow than hash map -
   but faster than linked hash map.
   hash table it is old but provide thread safety.

file handling in java
we need to have below three things in order ot read write a file
   1) path of the file that we want to read /write
   2) we need to navigate to that file
   3) we need to have a software installed on our computer to interact with that file.

we need to have below three things in order to read /write a file manually.
   1)path a file we can store inside a string.
   2)we can use the file input stream class to navigate  to that folder.
   3)we use a specified java class that can handle that filed  type.
