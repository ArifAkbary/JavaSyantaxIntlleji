Constructor:
      Constructor is a block of code that is used to construct object.

Why we use constructor:

      Constructor help us initialize object in cleaner and more readable way.
      They are better that mehtods becuse they are called automatically when we crate an objct.
      Most of the time fielda are private and becuse of this reason we cant access them out sid of
      the class in which they are declerd and cant initialize them .

How to use Constructor:

     we create constructor by writing a block of code that has same name as class name when we create of
     the object of the class and it is called automatically.

Rules:
1)   Constructors dont have return types not even void
2)   Constructors shoud have same name as class name.
3)   Constructors can have access modifiers like private public and protected .
4)   Constructors can not have non access modifies like static final synchronized
5)   Default constructor is provided by java if we dont write one
6)   when we create the object of class then constructor is call
if the class name is Dog Dog do1=new Dog();
7)   We can create mutltiple construtors to give the other use flexibility that they dont have
to privide all the values to all the instance feild when creating an object of our class.
8)  we can call the constroctor of al class by using this keyword with parenthesis.
this() we can pass parameters and java will decide base on these parameters which constructor to call.
"this " keyword:
when ever we can same name varibles as instance varible and local varibles this keyword can help us resolve
the conflict between local and instance variable.

class human{
String name="sleeping zombi;
void printname(){
String name="wake up zombia"
System.out.print(this.name);

}
}

what is inheritance:
     inheritance is a machanism in java throught which we can get the properties and methods from the
     parent class inside the child class.

     inheritance helps us reduce the amount of code that we have to write for example if there are some property
     and methods which are present in many different clasess we can create a parent class for all of those
     properties and can put the common properties or method inside that parent class and can make chidern clasess
     extand from that parent class.
1) create a parent class
2) put all the common methods and properties from childern  clasess inside that parent class.
3) use extands keyword to inherit from that parent class.

Rules:

1) private fields and private mehtods can not be inherited inside the childminder class.
