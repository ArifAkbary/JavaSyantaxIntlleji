FileHandling
   reading/writing data to a file is called file handling.
   the data that changed frequently we don't put that data with code because if we-
   have to change that data we need recover code and manipulate  the code on production servers again
   it is very long process and might take weeks .
   the other issue is might accidentally change the code as well when changing the data and might introduce bugs.
