what is super keyword:

     super keyword in java is used to refer to the class object.
why should be learn super keyword.
1) if we have same name variable or method in the super/parents /base class then we can use the super keyword to refer to
parent class variable or method because by default java prefers the variables of child class.
we can also call the super class constructor with helop of super with parenthesis super()

How we can use super keyword:
1) we can use super.method name or field name to call the method or to access the feid of super class
2)use the super with parenthesis to call the supper class constructors.

ruels:
1) we can only acess the immediate parent class construcor or field or method with
2) we can only use only super() inside a constructor.
3) if we have we have user constructor in the parent class we must have a mathching construcotr inside the child
class as well.
4) super() shoud be the first line in the construcor.
5) if we have multiple constructro inside the parent as soon as one mathched we are good to go we dont need
to each and every constructor form the parent class
