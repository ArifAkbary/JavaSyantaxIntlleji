what is super keyword:
     super keyword in java is used to refer to the class object.
     why should be learn super keyword.
    1) if we have same name variable or method in the super/parents /base class then we can use the super keyword to refer to-
    parent class variable or method because by default java prefers the variables of child class.
    2) we can also call the super class constructor with help of super with parenthesis super().

How we can use super keyword:
   1) we can use super.method name or field name to call the method or to access the filed of super class
   2)use the super with parenthesis to call the supper class constructors.

Rules:
   1) we can only access the immediate parent class constructor or field or method with.
   2) we can only use only super() inside a constructor.
   3) if we have we have user constructor in the parent class we must have a matching constructor inside the child-
   class as well.
   4) super() should be the first line in the constructor.
   5) if we have multiple constructor inside the parent as soon as one matched we are good to go, we don't need-
   to each and every constructor form the parent class.

What is methodOverLoading:
    when same name method exist in a class with different number of parameters or different type of-
    parameter or different sequence of parameter is called method over loading.
How we can use methodOverLoading:
We can have same name methods but we have to follow the below rules:
   1)by passing different number of parameters.
   2)we can change the data types of a parameters.
   3) we can also overload a method by changing the sequence of parameters.
