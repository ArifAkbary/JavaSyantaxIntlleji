What is a constructors in java:

   A constructor is special block of code that helps us give initial values to the fields of a class .
   initialization of object or instance.

why we should use constructor:
  1) When we use the constructor to initialize the object it loos more readable and cleaner.
  2)if the fields of a class are private its not possible to access them out side of class with our
  constructor or a method which means we can not initialize them with our a method or a constructor
  3)we can enforce rules like what kind of values are assigned to variables with the help of constructor.
  4) if we want make sure that some lines of code should always be executed when the object of a class created we
  put that code inside the constructor .

How to use Constructors.

   We create constrctors inside the class and when an object of that class is created the constructor is excuted
   automatically.
   example

   class car{
   String make;
   String model;


 car (String carMake, String carModel){
 make=carMake;
 model=carModel;///////<<<<<<<<<====constructor
 }

 public static void main(String []args){
 car bmw=new car("BMW","m4");
 }
 }

 Rules:

   1)Constructor don't have return types not even void.
   2)The name of constructor should always  be as name of the class.
   3)Constructor can not be created with a static keyword.
   4)we can use any modifiers with constructors
   5)If we don't create a constructor in a class a default constructors with zero parameters is created by compiler.
   compiler takes the code return by us and it converts that code to byte code which is easier for java to understand
  6)it is not allowed to have two constructor in a class with same number of parameter as same type.

   This keyword:
   We can use the "this" keyword to access the instance varibles when you have same name variables in your
   method or constructor or any block of code.

   this();
   calls the constructors of a class inside other constructors.
   why we should use because it helps us ruse already written constructors if they contain same code
   whe we want create multiple constructors on the first please because we want give end use flexibility
   that he can crete teh object of our class in money ways .
