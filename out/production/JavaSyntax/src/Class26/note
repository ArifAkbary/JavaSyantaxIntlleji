What is an interface:
   interface is a contract that is similar to a class but all the fields inside a class-
   static final (constants) and all the method by default are also public.

Why we learn:
  1) we can implements abstraction using interfaces.
  2) when classes are logic lay connect to each other and we want to have instance fields and implemented-
   methods as well while doing abstraction that we should go with abstract class.

How can i use interface:
   we use interface key worked instead of a class and we can start creating abstract method.

Rules:
1)all the fields inside an interface are public static and final.
2)no instance  methods inside interface all the methods by default are abstract.
3)when we implements the methods from the interface we use "implements" key word.
4)Multiples inheritance is supported by inheritance in java.
5)an interface can extend anther interface.

Encapsulation in Java:
    it 4 pillar of OOPS.
    It is a mechanism that provides us security. if we use encapsulation we can have
    more security.

    How can we should use:
    1)make your variables as private:
    2)we should create setter and getter method to read and write those fields.
