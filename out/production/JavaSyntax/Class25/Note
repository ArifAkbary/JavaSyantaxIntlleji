Recap:
what is abstraction:
   Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and only showing the functionality.

 why we should use abstraction :

 it reduce the complexity by separation the ideas from implementations;
 we can also rules on other classes.
 how can we use the abstraction
 we can use abstraction in our code with the help of abstract classes and interfaces.
 we create abstract method with header and mark the class as abstract now
 every class that will be inheriting from this class will implement those methods or mark the
 child class abstract as well.

  Rules"
  1) abstract methods cant have body
  2)as soon we have one abstract method in a class that ,class must be declared as abstract.
  3)once a class inherited from abstract class that class must implement the abstract method or should be mark abstract.
  4)we can have normal method with body and abstract method inside a class.
  5)abstract classes can not  be declared final class.
  6)we can have everything inside an abstract class that we can have in normal class only things that
  differs is we  can not  create the object of that class .
