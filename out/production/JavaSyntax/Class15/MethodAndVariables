what is the method:
    is a block code (group of statement).It defines the behaviour of a class.

Why we should use methods:
    it help us remove the duplicate code from our application.
    we just create a method and every time we need that logic we just-
    call the method that contains the logic.
    it also allows to write  the code in the form of modules which makes-
    the development of large application easier.

How to use methods:
    1)fist we create the method inside a class
    2)we create the object of the class
    3)we call the method by writing the name of the project a dot name of the method
Example:
    class Calculator {
    void add(int x, int y ){
    System.out.println(x+y)
    }
    if i need to call this method
    public static  void  main (String []args){
    Calculator calculator=new Calculator();
    calculator.add(10,50);
    }

Rules:
void: is a return type and it is a must if you want to return a specific data type like  an inger write for int or write String-
   if we don t want to return anythings we write void.
   when we write a void  we cant not assign a method call to a variable.
   next we write the name of the method which can be any things it should follow the rules for giving-
   name ot  available.
   ( ) we specify the parameters here we can pass any data type inside these parenthesis-
   they are optionals we can leave them empty.
   {
   System.out.println(x+y)
   }
   The body of the method tha contains the java statements
   add(int x, int y )
   this part with name of the method it and its parameter is called signature  of the class

Type of Variables in java
   there are 3 type of variable 1 local 2 static 3 instance.
local:
   if a variable is inside a method or part of parameters is on a loop or switch statement-
   or if else conditional is called local variable.

Instance:
   if variable is inside the class but out side of any block of code like method loop switch statement if else condition
   it called an instance variable.

Static variable:
  if an instance variable has a static keyword with it then it is called a static variable
  Types of Variables in java:

 Why learn about different types of variables:
     1) it helps us reduce the amount of RAM that our application will be using when it will be-
     running.
     2) With the help of these variables we can pass information between methods of class.
     3) Local variables occupy the memory for the shortest period of time as soon as your method is done
     executing they are destroyed by a special program called garbage collector.

 How to use these:
     Local: create inside block of code.
 Advantages vs disadvantages:
 Local variables:
 Advantages:
     They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time. Always try to use local
     variables when possible to save memory.
 Disadvantages:
     They are very limited in scope means we can't access them outside of method or that block
     of code.

 Instance variables:
 Advantages:
     They have broader scope as compared to local variables, means we can access in all the methods
     of that class.
 Disadvantages:
     They occupy the space in your RAM for longer periods of time.
 static Variables:
 Advantages:
     We can call static variables without creating an object of a class.
     We can share a single variable between all the objects of a class.
