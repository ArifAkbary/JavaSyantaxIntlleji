What is method overriding in java
     when same method with sme header exist in in the child class as well we call
     method overriding .
     why we shoud ovrride a method:
     if we inhertite from a class all the mather which not orivate they are inhertited in
     the child class

     if we dont like some of this metthers becuse thyey consum more interntet bandwidth or
     consume a lot of CPU or usear a lot memeory we can ovride them the child less.

     How can we use methodo overridiing :

         1)we must inhertie from a calss
         2)we can read declaer the method with same return

         rules:
         1)we nust a auper derived class telathionships
        2) method in java class must have same headr but they can be diffeent in threm of access
         modifeirs in very new condaion if terms of rtuen
         3).we cant change the access modifer from public in protected or defult.
         but we and do it in rverse order

         4)we cant override vonstructors becuse they are also not inherited.
         5)if a method is static we use a different terminology it is called method redecalatin.
         insted of overiding.
