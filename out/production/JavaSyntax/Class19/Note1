Recap:
Constructor:
     Constructor is a block of code that is used to construct object.
Why we use constructor:
     Constructor help us initialize object in cleaner and more readable way.
     They are better that methods because they are called automatically when we crate an object.
     Most of the time field are private and because of this reason we cant access them out sid of
     the class in which they are declarer and cant initialize them .
How to use Constructor:
     we create constructor by writing a block of code that has same name as class name when we create of
     the object of the class and it is called automatically.

Rules:
   1)   Constructors don't have return types not even void
   2)   Constructors should have same name as class name.
   3)   Constructors can have access modifiers like private public and protected .
   4)   Constructors can not have non access modifies like static final synchronized
   5)   Default constructor is provided by java if we don't write one
   6)   when we create the object of class then constructor is call
   if the class name is Dog Dog do1=new Dog();
   7)   We can create multiple constructors to give the other use flexibility that they don't have
   to provide all the values to all the instance filed when creating an object of our class.
   8)  we can call the constructor of al class by using this keyword with parenthesis.
   this() we can pass parameters and java will decide base on these parameters which constructor to call.
  "this " keyword:
   when ever we can same name variables as instance variable and local variables this keyword can help us resolve
  the conflict between local and instance variable.
Example:
   class human{
   String name="sleeping";
   void print name(){
   String name="wake up man"
   System.out.print(this.name);
   }
   }

What is inheritance:
     inheritance is a mechanism in java through which we can get the properties and methods from the
     parent class inside the child class.
     inheritance helps us reduce the amount of code that we have to write for example if there are some property-
     and methods which are present in many different classes we can create a parent class for all of those-
     properties and can put the common properties or method inside that parent class and can make child  classes-
     extend from that parent class.
    1) create a parent class.
    2) put all the common methods and properties from children classes inside that parent class.
    3) use extends keyword to inherit from that parent class.
Rules:
    1) private fields and private methods can not be inherited inside the children classes.
