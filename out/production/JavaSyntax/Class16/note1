There are three type of variables in java local instance static.
local variable
       Are the varibel which are create inside a block of code like mehtod.
       loop swithc statments if else condation or a cnstructor.



Advantages;
We shoudl always prefer local variables to instance or static varibles because they live for the shortes perid
time inside your RAM.

Disadvantages:
     They cant be accsed our side of the block of code in which they created
 class teast{
 void method1 (){
String person="elisa bro";

 }
 void Russia(){
 System.out.println(person)// we will get an error becuase right now person is only accesseibel in USA

 }
 Instance Variables
       They are creted inside the class but out side of block of code;

  Advanges:
     instance varible are accessiable every where in a class in all the block of code inside that class
     inside that class but not in a static method

     DisAdvantages:
     They keep on cccuyping the memory for longer period of time .
