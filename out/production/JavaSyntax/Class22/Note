what method overloading in java:
    with the hlep of method overloading we can have many methods with same name but different
    parameters in a class:

why we shoud use methodover loading.
     1)Cleaner code if multiple methods are doing the same thing we dont need to come up with
     different names.
     2)Flexibility for the end user.

how we can use methodoverloading in java.

    we can overload a method by changing three things
    1) number of parameters
    2)change the date type of parameters
    3)we can change the sequece of parameters.
class Calculator{
int method(int , int1 num2, int num3{
return num1+num2+num3;
}
int sum(int num1, int num2, int num3){
return num1+num2+num3;

}
}
Rules:
1)Method names shoud be same but parameters should be different.
2)we cant overload method by just changing it return  type
3)we can also overload constructors by following the same rules.

===============

what is methodOverrriding:
   Happens when same method exisist inside the parent class and the child class.
why we shoud overrride a method :
   If we are inheriting from a parent class we dont like the implementation of a method form
   the parents class we can provide our own implementation.
   sometimes it done to improve the performace of code.

How we can override a method:

   when we inherite from a class we just need to rewrite that mehtod inside the child class
   all sould be same except the body and access modifiers.

Rules
1) for override we must inherit from a class
2)the method in the parent class that we want to override must be exactly the same as method
int the child class only the access modifiers can be different
3) The access modifies in the parent class can only be incresed with respect to the
visibility for ecample we can change defualt to protecated or to public but we can not make it
private
4)if something is not inherited we cant override it for example private methdo and constructors
