What is a list:
    list if an interface inside the frame work which have below
    properties.
    1)insertion order is maintained.
    2)i can store duplicate data.

    list is implemented by many classes but we will be focusing or arraylist and
    linked list.
ArrayList:
   when my requirement is that i will be reading the data a lot then i should be going
   with ArrayList.
Linked List
    Most of our operation will be writing the data to a list in between or in the
    start or shifting data we should going with linked list.
iterator :
   is an interface that has three methods hasNext() and remove().
   whenever we try to modify the size of a list using simple loop there are
   chance that it will not work will thought an error
   because list is dynamic and can change the size at runtimes so to be always on
   the safe side we should  use iterators.
set:
1)Duplicate is not allowed
2)we will be discussing three types of sets :
   1)Hash Set
   2)linked hashset
   3)Tree set
Hashset :
upside:
    no insertion order is maintained but it is the fastest of all.
Down side:
    no iteration order is maintained.
Linked hashset:
Upside:
   insertion order is maintained.
Downside:
   retrieval of element will be super slow.
   insertion speed slow than faster.
TreeSet:
upside:
    elements will always be in sorted form.
Down side:
    insertion.
Map:
   map is an interface in java that allow us to store key value pairs
   we can not have duplicate keys but we can have duplicate values
   we will discussing three of them.
1)Hashmap
2)linked hashmap
3)Tree Map

Hash Map
Upside:
    fastest when it comes to insert and retrieve the element.
Downside:
    no insertion order.
LinkedHashmap:
Upside:
     insertion order will be maintain
Down side:
     retrieve will be slowest
Tree Map
Upside:
    data will be store in the sorted order.
Downside:
    insertion is the slowest.
