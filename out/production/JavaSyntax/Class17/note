Access Modifiers:
   Access Modifiers are keyword in java that help us control the accesses of class variable method others code of
   block there.
Four accesses level in java:
    private, default (it not keyword), protected ,public .
Private:
    when we use private keyword with a method or field it is only  accessible inside that class.
    it is most restricted access modifiers.
default: (it is not a keyword):
     when we don't use any access modifiers keyword with a filed or a method then default access is
     applied by java which means we can access this variable or method inside the dame as well as in all the others-
     class which exist inside the dame package.
Protected:
    we have protected access modifier we dcan access that method or variable inside the class inside the other class which-
    are inside same package inside the class which in different package as well buy they must have extends relationships with-
    original class.
Public :
   when we use the public access modifiers we can use tth filed or method anywhere inside the-
   same project.
